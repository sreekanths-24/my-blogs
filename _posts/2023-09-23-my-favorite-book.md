One of the books that I read recently is Atomic Habits by James Clear. I learned a lot about how to create new Habits and get out of bad habits. It is a must read and I will recommend this book to everyone.

In this book author James Clear talks about 4 laws to build better habits. This book inspired me to start some new habits, some of these new habits include :- 
1) jogging every morning
2) reading more books
3) learning new tech
4) sharing my knowledge on youtube
5) starting this blog page to write online.

Of course I didnt start all these new habits on a single day, a started habit staking one by one as mentioned in the book.
